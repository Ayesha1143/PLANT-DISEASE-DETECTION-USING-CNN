# PLANT-DISEASE-DETECTION-USING-CNN 🌱🧠

This project focuses on detecting plant diseases using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
The model is implemented in Python using Jupyter Notebook and is trained on an image dataset of healthy and diseased plant leaves.

The goal of this project is to help in early detection of plant diseases, which can be useful for agriculture and crop management.

## 📂 Project Files

This repository contains the following Jupyter Notebook files:

### 1️⃣ PLANT DISEASE IMPLEMENTATION.ipynb
- This notebook contains the **complete implementation** of the plant disease detection system.
- It includes:
  - Importing required libraries
  - Loading and preprocessing image data
  - Building the CNN model
  - Training the model
  - Evaluating model performance

### 2️⃣ plant disease detection .ipynb
- This notebook focuses on:
  - Data handling and preprocessing
  - Model experimentation and testing
  - Running predictions on plant leaf images

Both notebooks work together to demonstrate the full workflow of a CNN-based image classification project.
